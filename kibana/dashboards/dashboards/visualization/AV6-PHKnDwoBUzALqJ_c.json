These dashboards are designed to work at 1024x768 screen resolution in order to maximize compatibility.\\n\\nAs you search through the data in Kibana, you should see Bro logs, syslog, and Snort alerts.  Logstash should have parsed out most fields in most Bro logs and Snort alerts.\\n\\nNotice that the source_ip and destination_ip fields are hyperlinked.  These hyperlinks will take you to a dashboard that will help you analyze the traffic relating to that particular IP address (Indicator).\\n\\nUID fields are also hyperlinked.  This hyperlink will start a new Kibana search for that particular UID.  In the case of Bro UIDs this will show you all Bro logs related to that particular connection.\\n\\nEach log entry also has an _id field that is hyperlinked.  This hyperlink will take you to CapMe, allowing you to request full packet capture for any arbitrary log type!  This assumes that the log is for tcp or udp traffic that was seen by Bro and Bro recorded it correctly in its conn.log.  CapMe should try to do the following:\\n* retrieve the _id from Elasticsearch\\n* parse out timestamp\\n* if Bro log, parse out the CID, otherwise parse out src IP, src port, dst IP, and dst port\\n* query Elasticsearch for those terms and try to find the corresponding bro_conn log\\n* parse out sensor name (hostname-interface)\\n* send a request to sguild to request pcap from that sensor name\\n\\n\\nPreviously, in Squert, you could pivot from an IP address to ELSA.  That pivot has been removed and replaced with a pivot to Kibana.\\n\\nFor additional information, please refer to our documentation at:\\n\\nhttps://securityonion.net/wiki/Elastic\\n\\nAlso, please feel free to post any questions or concerns on our mailing list:\\n\\nhttps://securityonion.net/wiki/MailingLists#mailing-lists\"},\"aggs\":[],\"listeners\":{}}",
